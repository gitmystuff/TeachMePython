# Hello, Gemini, Please Teach Me Python

This guide is designed to use AI to learn Python, starting with the basics and moving towards advanced topics. This is a work in progress. This project explores **active learning**, where we are actively engaging with the material through coding exercises and problem-solving.

*How* you learn is just as important as *what* you learn. Research consistently shows that **active learning**, where you participate, practice, and apply what you learn, leads to deeper understanding and better retention compared to **passive learning**, such as simply reading or watching without engagement. We'll be leveraging this principle throughout our learning process, especially with hands-on practice in Google Colab.

This project also leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Gemini, by designing prompts that introduce concepts, provide explanations, offer deeper dives, and generate practice exercises.

## Outline

Here's version 1 of the topics covered:

**I. Getting Started with Python in Google Colab**
    * Introduction to Google Colab: Your interactive coding environment.
    * Your first Python code: Printing and basic operations.

**II. Python Fundamentals**
    * Variables and Data Types: Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans.
    * Operators: Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical.
    * Control Flow:
        * Conditional Statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`.
        * Loops: `for`, `while`.

**III. Data Structures**
    * Lists: Ordered, mutable collections.
    * Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections.
    * Dictionaries: Key-value pairs.
    * Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements.

**IV. Functions**
    * Defining and calling functions.
    * Function arguments and return values.
    * Scope of variables.

**V. Modules and Packages**
    * Importing and using built-in modules.
    * Introduction to external packages (e.g., `math`).

**VI. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    * Classes and Objects.
    * Attributes and Methods.
    * Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation (brief introduction).

**VII. Working with Files**
    * Reading from and writing to files.

**VIII. Error Handling**
    * `try`, `except` blocks.

**IX. Introduction to More Advanced Topics**
    * List comprehensions.
    * Generators.
    * Decorators (brief overview).

## Leveraging Gemini for Learning

For each topic, use the capabilities of Gemini through targeted prompts to enhance understanding and practice.

1.  **Introduce the Concept:**
    * **Prompt Example:** "Introduce the concept of 'variables' in Python."
    * Gemini's response would provide a simple and clear definition of variables and their basic usage.

2.  **Provide Explanations:**
    * **Prompt Example:** "Explain the different data types in Python with examples."
    * Gemini would elaborate on each data type and illustrate their use with code snippets.

3.  **Offer a Deeper Dive:**
    * **Prompt Example:** "Provide a more in-depth explanation of 'variables' and anything else that would be relevant."
    * Gemini would delve into the underlying mechanisms, offering a more advanced understanding.

4.  **Generate Practice Exercises in Colab:**
    * **Prompt Example:** "Generate a Google Colab notebook with practice exercises on Python variables and data types, including solutions."
    * Gemini would ideally output the Python code for a Colab notebook with exercises and their corresponding answers.

5.  **Provide Real Workd Examples:**
    * **Prompt Example:** "Provide real word examples that help clarify concepts like variables and data types."
    * Gemini would provide examples.

6.  **Generate a Problem:**
    * **Prompt Example:** "Generate a problem that would require problem-solving and critical thinking."
    * Gemini would ideally provide a problem to solve.
  
7.  **Offer Points for Reflection:**
    * **Prompt Example:** "Provide points that I can reflect on to help remember the topics just explored and how to integrate these into previous topics."
    * Gemini would ideally provide points for reflection and long term memory.
